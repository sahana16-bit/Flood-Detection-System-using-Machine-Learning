# Flood Detection System using Machine Learning

🌊 Flood Detection System using Machine Learning
🧠 Overview

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, causing severe loss of life, property, and infrastructure. This project aims to build a Machine Learning–based Flood Detection and Prediction System that analyzes environmental and meteorological data to predict potential flood risks accurately and in real time.

By leveraging data such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, river water level, and soil moisture, the model can classify whether flood conditions are likely to occur and issue early warnings to help communities and authorities take preventive measures.

⚙️ Features

📊 Data collection and preprocessing from multiple environmental sources

🤖 Machine Learning model (e.g., Random Forest / Logistic Regression / SVM) for flood prediction

📈 Visualization of weather parameters and flood probability

🛰️ Real-time data monitoring capability (optional IoT sensor integration)

💾 Model training and evaluation using historical flood datasets
